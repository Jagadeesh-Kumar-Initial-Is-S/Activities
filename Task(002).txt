1. Write a blog of the Difference between document & window objects

Document object

=>It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.
=>It is loaded inside the window.
=>It is the object of window property.
=>All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.
=>We can access the document from a window using the window.document
=>The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)
=>Properties of document objects such as little body, cookies, etc can also be accessed by a window like this window.document.title
=>syntax: document.propertyname;
=>example: document.title : will return the title of the document

Window object

=>It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.
=>It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.
=>It is the object of the browser.
=>Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.
=>We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window
=>The window is part of BOM, not DOM.
=>Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.
=>Syntax: window.propertyname;
=>example: window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser
